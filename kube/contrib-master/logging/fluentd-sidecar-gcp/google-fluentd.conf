# This Fluentd configuration file enables the collection of log files
# that can be specified at the time of its creation in an environment
# variable, assuming that the config_generator.sh script runs to generate
# a configuration file for each log file to collect.
# Logs collected will be sent to the Google Cloud Logging API.
#
# Currently the collector uses a text format rather than allowing the user
# to specify how to parse each file.
#
# This configuration assumes the correct installation of the the Google
# Fluentd plug-in, and that the VM host running this configuration is on
# Google Compute Engine and has been created with the logging.write scope.

# Pick up all the auto-generated input config files, one for each file
# specified in the FILES_TO_COLLECT environment variable.
@include files/*

# All the auto-generated files should use the tag "file.<filename>".
